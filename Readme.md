**`trigger`** | `String` `RegExp` | The trigger to match the inputed character againstâ€”either a character like `a` or a key name like `enter` or `tab`.
**`transform`** | `Function` | A function to apply the desired transform. It will be passed a Slate `Transform` object and the `data` object from the matching event handler.

**`ignoreIn`** (optional) | `Function` `Array` `String` | A block matcher to ignore triggers inside. If passed an array or string it will match by `node.type`.
**`onlyIn`** (optional) | `Function` `Array` `String` | A block matcher to only replace triggers inside. If passed an array or string it will match by `node.type`.
